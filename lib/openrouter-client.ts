      crack_cause: `STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT: Based on visual evaluation of the provided crack imagery, this appears to be a diagonal tension crack exhibiting characteristics consistent with structural movement and stress concentration. VISUAL ASSESSMENT: The crack displays a linear progression with variable width indicating active or recently active movement. The diagonal orientation suggests principal stress patterns typical of combined loading conditions. Surface texture shows clean fracture planes indicating brittle failure mode. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS: The crack geometry suggests tension failure under combined loading, potentially including thermal effects, differential settlement, or structural overloading. Stress distribution patterns indicate concentration at crack termination points, suggesting load path discontinuity. The diagonal orientation (approximately 45-60Â°) is characteristic of shear-tension failure in concrete or masonry elements. ENGINEERING EVALUATION: This crack pattern requires immediate structural assessment to determine load-bearing implications. The width and progression suggest active movement requiring monitoring and potential structural intervention. Non-compliance with acceptable crack width limits per CSA A23.3 may indicate structural distress requiring professional evaluation. RISK ASSESSMENT: Moderate structural risk due to potential load capacity reduction and progressive failure potential. Immediate safety concerns are limited but long-term structural integrity requires professional evaluation. PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Engage a qualified structural engineer (P.Eng) for comprehensive assessment including material testing, load analysis, and repair specifications. Consider non-destructive testing to evaluate internal conditions and reinforcement integrity.`,
